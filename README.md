## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned more semantic HTML elements like Summary and Details to
make an accordion without using Javascript. I did use Javascript to add additional functionality(only letting one section open at
a time).


### Continued development
I would like to come back to this challenge to make more improvements, I need to work more on layout and responsive
sites. I plan to work more on mobile design and integrate
landscape media queries.


### Useful resources

- (https://w3schools.com) - A great place to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- (https://validator.w3.org/) - Test all your sites and learn more
about semantic HTML and Accessibility.
